Healthie is a platform which health and wellness providers use to provide services for
their clients. We want to create a new feature which allows providers to create forms for
their clients to fill out. Using a drag-and-drop interface, they can create a type of form
which will then be filled out by multiple clients.
We want to support these types of form elements:

● text field
● select fields
● radio buttons
● checkboxes

Design the database schema you would use to implement this feature. The schema
should support both
● providers creating multiple types of forms which any client can fill out
● clients filling out a form with answers

# The questions for the forms will have a foreign_key to point to the form they belong to.
